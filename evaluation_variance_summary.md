# Evaluation Variance Analysis Summary

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. **Root Cause of Baseline Variance (0.6944 vs 0.8222)**

The dramatic difference in reported baselines is due to **high evaluation variance**:

- Current evaluator uses only **5 episodes**
- Standard deviation: ~0.08 (10% of mean)
- This creates a 95% CI of approximately **[0.67, 0.83]**
- Both 0.6944 and 0.8222 fall within this natural variance!

**Conclusion**: The baselines aren't actually different - they're samples from the same distribution with high variance.

### 2. **Time/Variance Tradeoff Analysis**

Based on theoretical analysis (6 seconds per episode):

| Episodes | Time  | Std Error | Can Detect | Efficiency |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 5        | 30s   | 0.040     | >15.7%     | 0.625      |
| 10       | 60s   | 0.028     | >11.1%     | 0.442      |
| **15**   | **90s**| **0.023** | **>9.1%**  | **0.361**  |
| 20       | 120s  | 0.020     | >7.8%      | 0.312      |
| 30       | 180s  | 0.016     | >6.4%      | 0.255      |

### 3. **Optimal Configuration: 15 Episodes**

The sweet spot balances time and precision:
- **Time**: ~90 seconds per evaluation
- **Precision**: Can detect >9% improvements
- **Variance reduction**: 50% compared to 5 episodes
- **Statistical power**: Sufficient for most experiments

### 4. **Implications for the 20% Improvement Claim**

The reported "20% improvement" needs re-evaluation because:
- It compared against baseline 0.6944 (low end of variance)
- True baseline is likely ~0.75 ± 0.04
- Need to re-test with consistent evaluation protocol

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. **Use Low-Variance Evaluation Protocol**
```python
# Standardized evaluation with 15 episodes
evaluator = LowVarianceEvaluator(num_episodes=15)
result = evaluator.evaluate_policy(policy)

# Report as mean ± 95% CI
print(f"{result['mean']:.3f} ± {result['ci_margin']:.3f}")
```

### 2. **Fixed Seed Protocol**
- Use `base_seed = experiment_id * 1000`
- Ensures reproducible, non-overlapping evaluations
- Example: Experiment 1 uses seeds 1000-1014

### 3. **For Different Use Cases**
- **Quick iteration**: 10 episodes (~60s, detects >11%)
- **Standard experiments**: 15 episodes (~90s, detects >9%)
- **Final validation**: 30 episodes (~180s, detects >6%)

### 4. **Statistical Reporting**
Always report:
- Mean ± 95% CI
- Number of episodes
- p-value for comparisons
- Effect size (Cohen's d)

## 📊 Visual Summary

The theoretical analysis shows:
1. **Linear time increase** with episodes
2. **Inverse square root decrease** in variance
3. **Efficiency peaks early** then decreases
4. **15 episodes** offers best practical balance

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Re-evaluate** best PPO model with 15-episode protocol
2. **Compare** against true SL baseline (~0.75)
3. **Verify** if improvements are statistically significant
4. **Report** confidence intervals, not just means

This analysis explains the baseline variance mystery and provides a robust evaluation framework for future experiments.
