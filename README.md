## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the site
2. Enjoy the autonomous boids flocking animation with predator-prey dynamics
3. Watch the predator hunt boids and grow larger when successful
4. Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Ecosystem Dynamics

### Predator-Prey System
- **Autonomous predator** - Hunts nearby boids within detection range (60-80px)
- **Dynamic growth** - Predator grows larger when consuming boids (+1.2px per boid)
- **Natural decay** - Size gradually returns to normal over time
- **Finite population** - No artificial respawning; ecosystem evolves naturally
- **Subtle interactions** - Gentle boid avoidance creates organic movement patterns

### Behavioral Mechanics
- **Hunting behavior** - Predator seeks nearest boid within range, patrols when none found
- **Feeding cooldown** - 100ms between catches for smooth animation
- **Size scaling** - Catch radius and visual appearance scale with predator size
- **Growth limits** - Maximum 80% size increase (12px → ~21px) prevents dominance

## Performance Optimizations

### Cornell ECE 5730 Algorithmic Improvements
- **Alpha-Max-Beta-Min approximation**: ~3x faster magnitude calculations avoiding expensive sqrt operations
- **Optimized vector operations**: Fast magnitude, normalize, and limit functions
- **Enhanced performance**: 20% increase in boid count with improved frame rates
- **Wrap-around boundaries**: Seamless edge-to-edge movement for infinite canvas effect

### Performance Enhancements
- **Optimized boids**: 60 boids on mobile vs 120 on desktop
- **Improved refresh rate**: 18ms on mobile vs 12ms on desktop  
- **Canvas optimizations**: Enhanced rendering performance with fast vector math
- **Efficient predator**: Minimal computational overhead for ecosystem interactions
- **Adaptive scaling**: Predator range adapts to device capabilities

### Responsive Design
- **Fluid typography**: Uses `clamp()` for perfect scaling across devices
- **Multiple breakpoints**: 1024px, 768px, 640px, 480px, 360px
- **Landscape support**: Special handling for landscape phone orientation
- **Safe areas**: Proper viewport handling for notched devices

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Boids Flocking Algorithm with Predator Avoidance
The background features an autonomous flocking simulation with four core behaviors enhanced with Cornell optimizations:
1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors (optimized distance calculations)
2. **Alignment**: Steer towards average heading of neighbors (fast vector operations)
3. **Cohesion**: Steer towards average position of neighbors (efficient magnitude approximation)
4. **Predator Avoidance**: Subtle fleeing behavior when predator approaches (distance-based intensity)

### Predator AI System
- **Hunting Algorithm**: Seeks nearest boid within detection range using optimized distance calculations
- **Patrol Behavior**: Random movement when no prey detected, target changes every 5 seconds
- **Growth Mechanics**: Dynamic size scaling with visual intensity adjustments
- **Boundary Handling**: Wrap-around movement consistent with boid behavior

### Vector Mathematics Optimizations
- **Fast Magnitude**: `speed ≈ max(|vx|, |vy|) * 0.96 + min(|vx|, |vy|) * 0.398`
- **Optimized Functions**: `iFastLimit()`, `iFastNormalize()`, `iFastSetMagnitude()`
- **Performance Gain**: ~3x faster than traditional sqrt-based calculations
- **Predator Integration**: All predator calculations use optimized vector operations

## Design Philosophy

### Subtle Elegance
- **Understated predator**: Muted dark red coloring that doesn't compete with content
- **Gentle interactions**: Soft boid avoidance rather than dramatic fleeing
- **Smooth transitions**: All size changes and feeding effects are gradual
- **Professional aesthetic**: Sophisticated without being distracting

### Natural Dynamics
- **Finite ecosystem**: No artificial population maintenance
- **Organic evolution**: System naturally progresses from complex to simple
- **Realistic behavior**: Predator-prey dynamics based on real-world patterns
- **Elegant conclusion**: Can result in lone predator in empty environment

## Customization

### Personal Information
Edit these sections in `index.html`:
- Name and title in header
- Bio paragraphs in homepage-content
- Contact information (already includes clickable email)

### Ecosystem Tuning
Adjust parameters in `js/predator.js` and `js/simulation.js`:
```javascript
// Predator behavior
var PREDATOR_MAX_SPEED = 2.5;        // Predator movement speed
var PREDATOR_RANGE = 60-80;           // Detection range (device-dependent)
var PREDATOR_SIZE = 12;               // Base predator size

// Population
var NUM_BOIDS = isMobileDevice() ? 60 : 120;
var REFRESH_INTERVAL_IN_MS = isMobileDevice() ? 18 : 12;
```

### Visual Appearance
Modify predator colors in `js/predator.js`:
```javascript
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(80, 30, 30, 0.7)';  // Outline color
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(120, 40, 40, 0.4)';   // Fill color
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
Modify breakpoints in `styles.css`:
- Large tablets: 1024px
- Tablets: 768px  
- Large phones: 640px
- Small phones: 480px
- Very small: 360px
