# Evolution Framework for RL Improvement

## Ground Truth Evidence Established

### ✅ **What We Know Works**
1. **PPO + Environment**: PPO training works with our BoidEnvironment without errors
2. **Baseline Performance**: ClosestPursuit achieves ~27% catch rate (established benchmark)
3. **Technical Integration**: Custom features extractors and stochastic policies integrate with stable-baselines3
4. **Evaluation System**: Existing evaluation system provides consistent, reliable measurements

### ❌ **What We Discovered Doesn't Work (Yet)**
1. **Simple Stochasticity**: Adding noise to ClosestPursuit strategy doesn't improve performance
2. **Short Training**: 2000 timesteps insufficient for meaningful learning
3. **Architecture Mismatch**: Complex transformer loading has compatibility issues

## Evolutionary Framework Design

### **Core Principle: Evidence-Based Incremental Improvement**

Each evolution step must:
1. **Have Clear Hypothesis**: What specific change should improve performance and why
2. **Measure Against Baseline**: Use evaluation system as single source of truth
3. **Validate Technical Components**: Ensure training works before measuring performance
4. **Build on Success**: Each successful step becomes the new baseline

### **Evolution Step Template**

```python
# Evolution Step N Template
def evolution_step_N():
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: [Specific change and expected improvement]
    BASELINE: [Current best performance]
    CHANGE: [Minimal specific modification]
    SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Quantitative improvement threshold]
    """
    
    # 1. Implement minimal change
    # 2. Validate technical functionality  
    # 3. Train with reasonable parameters
    # 4. Evaluate with existing evaluation system
    # 5. Compare against established baseline
    # 6. If successful, update baseline for next step
```

## Next Evolution Steps (Recommended)

### **Step 1A: Fix Current Approach**
**Issue**: No improvement from stochastic ClosestPursuit
**Hypothesis**: Need longer training or better reward signal
**Test**: 
- Increase training to 20K timesteps
- Add reward shaping to encourage exploration
- Use different action noise levels (0.05, 0.2, 0.5)

### **Step 1B: Better Policy Architecture**
**Hypothesis**: MLP with pursuit features is too simple
**Test**:
- Add recurrent layer (LSTM) for temporal reasoning
- Include relative velocity and predicted intercept features  
- Test if network can learn better pursuit strategies

### **Step 1C: Reward Engineering**
**Hypothesis**: Default reward doesn't incentivize optimal behavior
**Test**:
- Add reward for moving toward predicted boid positions
- Penalize inefficient movement patterns
- Reward faster catches (time bonus)

### **Step 2: Transformer Integration**
**Only attempt after Step 1 shows improvement**
**Hypothesis**: Transformer's learned representations + RL fine-tuning > simple pursuit
**Test**:
- Fix transformer loading issues
- Apply successful techniques from Step 1 to transformer
- Compare transformer+RL vs best performing simple policy

## Implementation Guide

### **File Structure**
```
evolution_step1a.py  # Longer training test
evolution_step1b.py  # Better architecture test  
evolution_step1c.py  # Reward engineering test
evolution_step2.py   # Transformer integration (only if 1A-C succeed)
```

### **Success Metrics**
- **Technical Success**: Training completes without errors
- **Performance Success**: >2% improvement over baseline (statistically significant)
- **Consistency**: Improvement holds across multiple random seeds
- **Generalization**: Works on different scenarios (easy, medium, hard)

### **Validation Protocol**
1. Run each evolution step 3 times with different seeds
2. Use evaluation system with ≥10 episodes per scenario
3. Compare against established baselines using t-test
4. Document all negative results to avoid repeating failed approaches

## Current Status

### **Completed Foundation**
- ✅ PPO environment integration works
- ✅ Stochastic policy interfaces implemented
- ✅ Evaluation system integration established
- ✅ Baseline performance measured (ClosestPursuit ~27%)

### **Ready for Next Steps**
- 🎯 **Step 1A**: Test longer training with current approach
- 🎯 **Step 1B**: Test better policy architecture
- 🎯 **Step 1C**: Test reward engineering
- ⏳ **Step 2**: Transformer integration (pending Step 1 success)

### **Key Insights**
1. **Complexity is the Enemy**: Start with simplest possible changes
2. **Training Time Matters**: 2K timesteps likely insufficient for learning
3. **Architecture Mismatch**: Transformer compatibility needs resolution
4. **Evaluation is Gold Standard**: Trust the evaluation system results

This framework ensures systematic, evidence-based improvement while avoiding the complexity traps that led to inconclusive results in previous approaches.

## Usage

```bash
# Test each evolution step systematically
python3 evolution_step1a.py  # Longer training
python3 evolution_step1b.py  # Better architecture
python3 evolution_step1c.py  # Reward engineering

# Only proceed to transformer if any of above succeed
python3 evolution_step2.py   # Transformer integration
```

The key is to find **one approach that shows improvement**, then build on that success rather than trying multiple complex changes simultaneously.
