# RL Training Key Learnings

## Summary
After extensive debugging, we discovered that PPO training was working correctly all along. The issue was a mismatch in evaluation methodology.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Episode Length Matters
- **Problem**: We trained with 200 max steps but the baseline used 500 steps
- **Solution**: Use 500 max steps for both training and evaluation
- **Impact**: Baseline went from apparent 28% to actual 6-8% with 200 steps

### 2. Environment Parity is Critical
- **Problem**: Training and evaluation environments had different random seeds
- **Solution**: Use fixed seeds for reproducible results
- **Verification**: Achieved perfect 0.0 difference between environments

### 3. Simple Features Work Well
- **Finding**: Simple closest-pursuit features (6 dimensions) are sufficient
- **Components**: Distance, direction, boid speed, predator velocity
- **Network**: Small MLP with [64, 32] hidden layers

### 4. Standard PPO Hyperparameters are Fine
- **Learning rate**: 3e-4
- **Batch size**: 64
- **N steps**: 1024 (for 500-step episodes)
- **Training time**: 40K timesteps (~1-2 minutes)

## Quick Start

### Training
```bash
python3 rl_train_simple.py --train
```

### Evaluation
```bash
python3 rl_train_simple.py --eval
```

### Both
```bash
python3 rl_train_simple.py --train --eval
```

## Performance Expectations
- **Baseline (ClosestPursuit)**: ~6-8% with fixed seed, 500 steps
- **Trained PPO**: Should match or exceed baseline
- **Training indicators**: Reward increases from ~45 to ~65+

## Common Issues Resolved
1. **"PPO not learning"** → It was learning, just evaluated incorrectly
2. **"28% vs 6% baseline"** → Different episode lengths
3. **"Environment mismatch"** → Fixed with consistent seeding
4. **"Complex features needed"** → Simple features work fine

## Next Steps
The PPO system is validated and working. You can now:
1. Train longer for better performance
2. Try different reward functions
3. Experiment with network architectures
4. Add curriculum learning
5. Integrate with transformer models
