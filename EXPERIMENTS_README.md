# Systematic RL Validation Experiments

This directory contains a comprehensive experimental framework designed to **systematically prove** that our PPO RL system improves upon the SL baseline with **statistical rigor**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Validation Goals

We aim to prove the following core hypotheses:

1. **Primary Hypothesis**: PPO RL training significantly improves catch rate over SL baseline
2. **Reproducibility**: RL improvement is consistent across independent training runs  
3. **Statistical Significance**: Improvement has p < 0.05 with meaningful effect size
4. **Robustness**: Improvement holds across different hyperparameters and conditions
5. **Generalization**: Improvement generalizes across different simulation scenarios

- **Effect Size**: 0.5-1.2 (medium to large)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No improvement detected"**
- Check learning rate (try 1e-4 to 1e-3)
- Increase training iterations (30-50)
- Verify reward function is working
- Check for convergence in loss curves

**"Inconsistent results"**
- Increase number of trials (10-15)
- Use larger rollout sizes (2048-4096)
- Check for implementation bugs
- Verify random seeds are working

**"Statistical significance not reached"**
- Increase sample size (more trials)
- Longer training per trial
- Check effect size - might still be meaningful
- Consider hyperparameter tuning

### Debug Commands

# Test basic functionality
python quick_ppo_test.py

# Run minimal experiments

# Check individual components
python -m rl_training.ppo_trainer
